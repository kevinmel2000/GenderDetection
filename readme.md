gender_classification_challenge

##Overview

This is the code for the gender classification challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by ilyas ahsan. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.
